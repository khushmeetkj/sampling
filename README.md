# Using various sampling Methods to train ML models on imbalanced and comparing their accuracies
We are given an imbalanced dataset on which we need to apply various sampling methods and train various ML models and then draw conclusions about their accuracies.

The various sampling methods that we'll be using are:
  1. Random Sampling
  2. Systematic Sampling
  3. Stratified Sampling
  4. Cluster Sampling
  
The various ML models that we'll be using are:
  1. SVM
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Decision Tree
  4. KNN
  5. Naive Bayes
